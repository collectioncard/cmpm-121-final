# cmpm-121-final
# Devlog Entry - [11/12/24]
Team Members: Thomas Wessel, Jacqueline Gracey, Jarod Spangler, Jack Wilhelm


## Introducing the team
* Tools Lead - Thomas Wessel: Will help everyone get their tools set up, manage source control, and establish code style conventions.
* Engine Lead - Jacqueline Gracey: Look into alternative engines in case of swapping and be the got to for knowledge about this alternate engine. Manage folder organization among everyone.
* Engine Assistant - Michael Campanile: Assist the lead in researching engines and learning more about these alternatives as well as organize assets and files in accordance with the lead.
* Producer - Jarod Spangler: Will help manage the direction of the game, help manage time and work delegation, as well as a little bit of everything. Help contribute to the style of the game, and help design or decide on art assets, as well as guide the vision for gameplay, and help write code.
* Design Lead- Jack Wilhelm: Will help write code alongside working with artistic and systematic ideas and goals, as well as help guide gameplay.

## Tools and materials
1. Engine: We are choosing to use Godot. The majority of the team primarily only has experience with phaser, but we feel Godot can be more versatile without too extreme of a learning curve. Since Godot is the only other engine some team members have experience with, it shouldn't be too hard to get everyone up to speed.
2. Programming Languages: Godot is mainly compatible with C# and GDScript. We are choosing to use C#, because it would be better to switch from C# to GDScript than the other way around, if necessary.
3. Tools: 
	 - IDEs:
		 - The team will have a choice of using their preferred editor between Godot's default, Jetbrains Rider, or VS Code
	 - Asset Development:
		 - Spritework will be done using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) as some of our team has used it before and feels comfortable using and teaching it.
	 - Linters/pre-commit hooks:
		 - For now, we are probably going to use c sharpier. Other tools might be included as we go along.

4. Alternate Platform: The alternate platform would be using Godot with GDScript.
## Outlook
* Unique Goals: We plan to integrate a train into the gameplay, which would be unique. We also plan to integrate procedural generation into generating the 2D tile map.
* Challenges: The biggest challenges we anticipate are making sure everything is coded in ways that are readable and iterable for the entire team. The main programmatic challenge we anticipate is pathing for the train. 
* Learning Goals: Learn to use a more advanced engine like Godot. Learn and practice meaningful programming patterns, while putting them into practice. Learning to better work on a team.
